This is an FAQ (Frequently asked questions) Chatbot related to Covid-19
The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, arising from December 2019, led to the COVID-19 pandemic. The present population-wide home quarantine procedures, which were implemented simultaneously throughout the world to halt and prevent the spread of COVID-19, are remarkable. Due to community-wide mitigating efforts adopted by several countries, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted daily services. Because there is a slim chance of finding a cure in the foreseeable future, global efforts have largely concentrated on social isolation and, in some cases, entire city and state lockdowns as the sole ways to manage the pandemic. To preserve functionality in many parts of life, these mitigating techniques have prompted the employment of technology. As COVID-19 spreads over the world and we practice social distancing, technologies like Chatbots are stepping in to assist. Because users can't wait to talk to a real person, this information must be received immediately, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The World Health Organization (WHO) answers frequently asked questions about the Coronavirus. However, users may have to look for a long time before finding the correct solution to their query. To effectively limit mass spread it is critical that individuals are aware of current policies. On that account, chatbots are ideal for users looking for COVID-19-related information.
